## About

This repository serves as a centralized resource for exploring Databricks concepts such as:

- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) with Databricks
- Machine Learning with Apache Spark
- Delta Lake optimizations
- Collaboration and workflows for data scientists and engineers
- Performance tuning and monitoring in Databricks

The repository aims to provide a hands-on approach with examples, scripts, and tutorials.

## Features

- Tutorials and Notebooks for key concepts
- Solutions to common Databricks challenges
- Real-world applications
- Best practices for building scalable pipelines
- Exploration of Databricks integrations (e.g., Azure, AWS, MLFlow)

## Technologies

This repository leverages the following technologies and languages:

- **Apache Spark**: The powerful distributed processing engine
- **Databricks CLI**: For automation and scripting
- **Delta Lake**: For reliable data lakes
- **Python**: Primary language for notebook development
- **SQL**: Used for querying and analysis
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Documenting experiments and workflows
